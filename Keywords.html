<h1>keywords</h1>
In C language, a keyword is a reserved word that has a specific meaning and purpose in the language. Keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are already reserved for specific uses.
<h1>control structures decision making and branching</h1>
In C language, decision-making and branching control structures are used to make decisions based on certain conditions and execute different sets of statements based on those decisions.<br>

The if statement is a common decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. Here's an example:<br>

int num = 5;<br>

if (num > 0) {<br>
    printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
}<br>

In this example, the if statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the block of code inside the curly braces { }, which in this case, prints a message to the console indicating that the number is positive.<br>

The if-else statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute one block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. Here's an example:<br>


int num = -2;<br>

if (num > 0) {<br>
    printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
} else {<br>
    printf("The number is non-positive.\n");<br>
}<br>

In this example, the if-else statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the first block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is positive. If it is not, the program executes the second block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is non-positive.<br>

The switch statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. Here's an example:<br>

int num = 3;<br>

switch (num) {<br>
    case 1:<br>
        printf("The number is one.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    case 2:<br>
        printf("The number is two.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    case 3:<br>
        printf("The number is three.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    default:<br>
        printf("The number is not one, two, or three.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
}<br>

In this example, the switch statement checks the value of the variable num. Depending on the value, the program executes a different block of code. If num is 1, the program prints a message indicating that the number is one. If num is 2, the program prints a message indicating that the number is two. If num is 3, the program prints a message indicating that the number is three. If num is any other value, the program executes the default block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is not one, two, or three.<br>

Overall, decision-making and branching control structures are important for creating dynamic and flexible programs that can handle different situations based on certain conditions.<br>
Here are some examples of C language keywords:

int: used to declare a variable as an integer type
float: used to declare a variable as a floating-point type
if: used to specify a condition for conditional statements
while: used to specify a condition for a loop statement
return: used to return a value from a function
switch: used to specify a set of possible values for a variable and execute different code blocks based on the value of the variable.<br>
Here is an example of how keywords are used in a C program:

#include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
       int num1, num2, sum;
       
       printf("Enter two numbers: ");
       scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);
       
       sum = num1 + num2;
       
       printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d", num1, num2, sum);
       
       return 0;
    }


    In this example, int, printf, scanf, and return are all C keywords that have a specific meaning 
    in the language. The variables num1, num2, and sum are declared using the int keyword to specify that they are integer types. 
    The if keyword is not used in this example, but it could be used to specify a condition for a conditional statement.
