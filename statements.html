<h1>statements</h1>
In C language, a statement is a line of code that performs a specific action. A C program is composed of one or more statements that are executed sequentially. Here are some examples of statements in C:<h1>control structures decision making and branching</h1>
In C language, decision-making and branching control structures are used to make decisions based on certain conditions and execute different sets of statements based on those decisions.<br>

The if statement is a common decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. Here's an example:<br>

int num = 5;<br>

if (num > 0) {<br>
    printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
}<br>

In this example, the if statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the block of code inside the curly braces { }, which in this case, prints a message to the console indicating that the number is positive.<br>

The if-else statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute one block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. Here's an example:<br>


int num = -2;<br>

if (num > 0) {<br>
    printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
} else {<br>
    printf("The number is non-positive.\n");<br>
}<br>

In this example, the if-else statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the first block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is positive. If it is not, the program executes the second block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is non-positive.<br>

The switch statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. Here's an example:<br>

int num = 3;<br>

switch (num) {<br>
    case 1:<br>
        printf("The number is one.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    case 2:<br>
        printf("The number is two.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    case 3:<br>
        printf("The number is three.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
    default:<br>
        printf("The number is not one, two, or three.\n");<br>
        break;<br>
}<br>

In this example, the switch statement checks the value of the variable num. Depending on the value, the program executes a different block of code. If num is 1, the program prints a message indicating that the number is one. If num is 2, the program prints a message indicating that the number is two. If num is 3, the program prints a message indicating that the number is three. If num is any other value, the program executes the default block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is not one, two, or three.<br>

Overall, decision-making and branching control structures are important for creating dynamic and flexible programs that can handle different situations based on certain conditions.<br>

    int num = -2;<br>
    
    if (num > 0) {<br>
        printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
    } else {<br>
        printf("The number is non-positive.\n");<br>
    }<br>
    
    In this example, the if-else statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the first block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is positive. If it is not, the program executes the second block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is non-positive.<br>
    
    The switch statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. Here's an example:<br>
    
    int num = 3;<br>
    
    switch (num) {<br>
        case 1:<br>
            printf("The number is one.\n");<br>
            break;<br>
        case 2:<br>
            printf("The number is two.\n");<br>
            break;<br>
        case 3:<br>
            printf("The number is three.\n");<br>
            break;<br>
        default:<br>
            printf("The number is not one, two, or three.\n");<br>
            break;<br>
    }<br>
    
    In this example, the switch statement checks the value of the variable num. Depending on the value, the program executes a different block of code. If num is 1, the program prints a message indicating that the number is one. If num is 2, the program prints a message indicating that the number is two. If num is 3, the program prints a message indicating that the number is three. If num is any other value, the program executes the default block of code, which prints a message indicating that the number is not one, two, or three.<br>
    
    Overall, decision-making and branching control structures are important for creating dynamic and flexible programs that can handle different situations based on certain conditions.<br>
 } else {
    printf("The number is negative or zero\n");
 }

 In this statement, the if statement checks if the value of num is greater than zero. If the condition is true, the message "The number is positive" is printed. Otherwise, the message "The number is negative or zero" is printed.

Loop statement: This statement repeats a set of instructions multiple times. For example:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("The value of i is %d\n", i);
 }

 In this statement, the for loop is used to print the value of the variable i from 0 to 9.

Return statement: This statement returns a value from a function. For example:

int square(int num) {
    return num * num; <h1>control structures decision making and branching</h1>
    In C language, decision-making and branching control structures are used to make decisions based on certain conditions and execute different sets of statements based on those decisions.<br>
    
    The if statement is a common decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. Here's an example:<br>
    
    int num = 5;<br>
    
    if (num > 0) {<br>
        printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>
    }<br>
    
    In this example, the if statement checks whether the value of num is greater than 0. If it is, the program executes the block of code inside the curly braces { }, which in this case, prints a message to the console indicating that the number is positive.<br>
    
    The if-else statement is another decision-making control structure in C. It allows the program to execute one block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. Here's an example:<br>
    
    
    int num = -2;<br>
    
    if (num > 0) {<br>
        printf("The number is positive.\n");<br>

 In this statement, the square() function takes an integer as input, and returns the square of that integer. <h1>control structures decision making and branching</h1>

Each of these statements performs a specific action in a C program. By combining different types of statements, programmers can create complex programs that can perform a wide range of tasks.
