In C programming language, a pointer to pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another pointer. A pointer to structure is a variable that holds the memory address of a structure.<br>

Here is an example program that demonstrates pointer to pointer and pointer to structure:<br>

#include <stdio.h><br>

struct student {<br>
    char name[50];<br>
    int age;<br>
};<br>

int main() {<br>
    struct student stu = {"John Doe", 20};<br>
    struct student *ptr1;<br>
    struct student **ptr2;<br>

    ptr1 = &stu;<br>
    ptr2 = &ptr1;<br>

    printf("Name: %s\n", (*ptr2)->name);<br>
    printf("Age: %d\n", (*ptr2)->age);<br>

    return 0;<br>
}<br>
-->In this program, a structure student is defined with two fields name and age. Then, an instance of the structure stu is created and initialized with the values "John Doe" and 20.<br>

Next, a pointer ptr1 to the structure student is declared and initialized to the memory address of stu. Then, a pointer ptr2 to a pointer to the structure student is declared and initialized to the memory address of ptr1.<br>

To access the fields of the structure stu using the pointer to pointer ptr2, we use the -> operator twice: the first -> operator dereferences ptr2 to obtain ptr1, and the second -> operator dereferences ptr1 to obtain the structure stu.<br>

The program then prints the name and age of the structure stu using the dereferenced pointer to pointer ptr2.<br>

Note that using pointers to pointers and pointers to structures can be useful in situations where we need to pass pointers to functions or return pointers from functions.<br>
