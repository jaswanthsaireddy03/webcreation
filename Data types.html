<centre><h1>datatypes</centre></h1>
In C language, a data type is a classification of data that specifies the type of values that can be stored in a variable and the operations that can be performed on those values. C language provides several built-in data types, each with its own size, range of values, and operations.<br>

Here are some examples of C language data types:<br>

int: used to store integers, which are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, int myNumber = 42;<br>
float: used to store floating-point numbers, which are decimal numbers. For example, float myFloat = 3.14;<br>
double: used to store double-precision floating-point numbers, which are decimal numbers with higher precision than floats. For example, double myDouble = 3.14159265359;<br>
char: used to store characters, which are single letters or symbols. For example, char myChar = 'a';<br>
bool: used to store boolean values, which are either true or false. For example, bool myBool = true;<br>

Here is an example of how data types are used in a C program:<br>

#include <stdio.h><br>

    int main() {<br>
       int num1 = 42;<br>
       float num2 = 3.14;<br>
       double num3 = 3.14159265359;<br>
       char myChar = 'a';<br>
       bool myBool = true;<br>
    
       printf("The value of num1 is %d\n", num1);<br>
       printf("The value of num2 is %f\n", num2);<br>
       printf("The value of num3 is %lf\n", num3);<br>
       printf("The value of myChar is %c\n", myChar);<br>
       printf("The value of myBool is %d\n", myBool);<br>
    
       return 0;<br>
    }<br>
    

    In this example, variables num1 is an int, num2 is a float, num3 is a double,<br>
     myChar is a char, and myBool is a bool. Each of these variables is assigned a value of the <br>
     appropriate data type. The printf statements use format specifiers to print the values of these variables.<br>
      Note that %d is used 
     to print an int, %f is used to print a float, %lf is used to print a double, %c is used to print a char, 
     and %d is used to print a bool (which is converted to an integer with a value of 0 or 1).<br>
