In C language, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. The result of an expression is often a value, which can be assigned to a variable or used in another expression.<br>

Here are some examples of expressions in C:<br>

Arithmetic expressions: These expressions use arithmetic operators to perform mathematical operations. For example:<br>

int x = 10 + 5;<br>
float y = 2.0 * x / 3.0;<br>

In the first expression, the values 10 and 5 are added together, and the result is assigned to the variable x. In the second expression, the value of x is multiplied by 2.0, divided by 3.0, and the result is assigned to the variable y.

Comparison expressions: These expressions use comparison operators to compare two values. For example:<br>

int a = 10;<br>
int b = 5;<br>
if (a > b) {<br>
   printf("a is greater than b\n");<br>
}<br>

In this expression, the if statement compares the values of a and b using the greater than (>) operator. If a is greater than b, the message "a is greater than b" is printed to the console.<br>

Logical expressions: These expressions use logical operators to combine two or more conditions. <br>For example:<br>

int x = 10;<br>
if (x > 0 && x < 20) {<br>
   printf("x is between 0 and 20\n");<br>
}<br>

In this expression, the if statement checks if x is greater than 0 and less than 20 using the logical AND (&&) operator. If both conditions are true, the message "x is between 0 and 20" is printed.<br>

Function call expressions: These expressions call functions to perform specific tasks. For example:<br>

int result = square(5);<br>

In this expression, the square() function is called with an argument of 5. The function calculates the square of 5 and returns the result, which is assigned to the variable result.<br>

Assignment expressions: These expressions assign a value to a variable. For example:<br>

int x;<br>
x = 42;<br>

In the first expression, the variable x is declared without a value. In the second expression, the value 42 is assigned to x using the assignment operator (=).<br>

Each of these expressions performs a specific task in a C program. By combining different types of expressions, programmers can create complex programs that can perform a wide range of tasks.<br>
